      <blockquote>
        <p>I’ve always been fascinated with technology.  The first computer we had in our home was a Macintosh Classic II, I was in grade school.  I spent countless hours on mac paint.  I had no clue how it worked back then, just that my dad told me I had to keep magnets away from it.  Drawing in mac paint was great but I quickly learned I could make my drawings move using hypercard.  Drawing characters in backgrounds, copying, then pasting them on the next card adjusting them just so much to create movement, frame by frame, I was making my first animations telling little stories.  When I was in 5th grade we got some new next door neighbors.  They were a middle aged english couple with a single son Martin.  He was ten years older than me, had a way larger lego collection and an atari.  I’d never played video games on a tv at home before, I was blown away.  I’ve been an avid gamer since then.  Just manipulating an images on a screen under my control was amazing to me.  I excelled in science and math in high school, applied and was accepted to University of Victoria’s engineering program, I switched majors, a lot.  Business, Economic, Art, Film…  finally i took an acting class, and that was it for me.  I immediately fell in love with acting.  I auditioned for <a href="http://www.circlesquare.org/">Circle in the Square theatre School</a> in New York, was accepted and moved to manhattan.  I spent my twenties in the city doing plays and commercials, it was great.  I was on top of the world, for a while.  Acting work waned, I was supporting my self working in restaurants, I wasn’t happy anymore.  I’d find myself more and more at <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nyclan-of-by-for-the-gamers-25643.phtml">NYCLAN</a> a now defunct basement gaming lounge in greenwich village.  Where I played many games of Halo 2 and met a lifelong friend and web developer Oliver.  Oli has been my friend for eight years, he’s the one who persuaded me to back to my roots, back to my love of tech.  So I looked into what he does for a living, and I liked what I saw.  So I moved back west and applied to code school.  At the time of writing this I’m finishing up my first week at Epicodus.
