            <p class="main-text">An oregon native, when not behind a keyboard I can be found enjoying the outdoors with friends, dogs, and craftbeer.  I try to stay active with running and in the summer, pickup basketball games.  I'm also a top-tier <a href="https://battlefieldtracker.com/bf1/profile/psn/I_Rivers_I">Battlefield player</a>.

        <p class="main-text">I’ve always been fascinated with technology.  The first computer we had in our home was a Macintosh Classic II, I was in grade school.  I spent countless hours on mac paint.  I had no clue how it worked back then, just that my dad told me to keep magnets away from it.  Drawing in mac paint kept my intrest for a while but I quickly learned I could make my pictures move using hypercard.  I'd start by drawing characters in backgrounds, copying, then pasting them on to the next 'card'.  Then adjusting them just so much to create movement, frame by frame, I was making my first animations, telling little stories.  When I was in 5th grade we got new nextdoor neighbors.  They were a middle-aged English couple with a single son, Martin.  He was ten years older than me, had a much larger lego collection, and an Atari.  I’d never played video games on a tv at home before, I was blown away.  I’ve been an avid gamer since.  Just manipulating images on a screen under my control was amazing to me.  In highschool I excelled in science, math, and art.  I applied and was accepted to <span class="under"><a href="http://www.uvic.ca/">University of Victoria</a></span>'s engineering program, I switched majors, a lot.  Business, Economic, Art, Film…  Finally I took an acting class, and that was it for me.  I immediately fell in love with acting.  I auditioned for <a href="http://www.circlesquare.org/"><span class="under">Circle in the Square theatre School</span></a> in New York, was accepted and moved to Manhattan.  I spent my twenties in the city doing plays and commercials, it was great.  I was on top of the world, for a while.  Acting work waned, I was supporting my self working in restaurants, I wasn’t happy anymore.  I’d find myself more and more at <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nyclan-of-by-for-the-gamers-25643.phtml"><span class="under">NYCLAN,</span></a> a now defunct basement gaming lounge in Greenwich village.  Where I played many games of Halo 2 and met lifelong friends.  One of which, Oliver, was a web developer.  I've now been friends with Oli for more than eight years, he’s the one who persuaded me to go back to my roots, back to my love of tech.  So I looked into what he does for a living, started to dabble with code, Javascript in particular and I liked it.  Logically the next step was to move back west and apply to code school.  Now, at the time of writing this I’m finishing up my first week at Epicodus.</p>
